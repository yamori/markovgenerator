TextGenerator.Read in the text file
TextGenerator.Build up the HashMap

Test. A tiny markov table, just to visualize etc.
MarkovHashMap.Implement the random Key method in Markov Hash Map

TextGenerator.Build the new text (seperate method)
TextGenerator.Junits? for when the markov hashmap is small, execution still completes but with generated text less than desired length.



Execution strategy.
	Instantiating object does not do anything!!
	generateString should be public, put everything through there.
	


Apache CLI.
takes interactive flag, and goes to scanner for input.

Make it executable jar through maven.  Compilable etc?

Main() - CLI take location, k, and m, if no -i then executes as such.

verbose flag for printing out bifurcations. also as scanner input.

All.Tidy up, comment with javadocs for all public methods.

HERE

Readme doc
	Decent explanation of the data struct.

Upload as maven dependency?  (Figure this out)
